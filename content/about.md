This place is an outlet for mind of a developer. Plain and simple. If you would like to know more about me, then read on.

### Brief highlights

* Born in the early eighties
* Interest in computers started in the early nineties
* First education in the IT field started in the early two thousands

### Recent

Consultant firm where I since 2013 have been helping to create mobile applications.

#### Working at [Dansk Scanning](http://www.danskscanning.dk)

### The unusual bits

Unlike many in the IT field:

* I cannot carry a tune
* I cannot play an instrument
* I do not drink coffee
* I do not drink beer
