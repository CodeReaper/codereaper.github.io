Once upon a time something happened to [Docker](https://www.docker.com), the CLI tool for managing images and containers on your machine. Docker had begone changing and with change by change over time had become something different.

The most evident changes being:

- A license is required for certain use cases
- The installation now includes a desktop application

Seemingly innocent enough changes - _but read on_ - however they do introduce annoyances in the form of:

- Constant updates
- Being logged out every time you update
- Needing to have an actual application running

Having been annoyed for long enough I wanted to investigate what the alternatives were...

## Podman Desktop

Everywhere you look for alternatives to Docker you find people mentioning [Podman](https://podman.io) as a free drop-in replacement for Docker.

These are people who do not understand the meaning of [drop-in replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop-in_replacement). I am not saying Podman is not more secure or faster or does not have more or better features. I am saying you cannot install Podman and alias `podman` to `docker` and have everything just work.

## Rancher Desktop

Spend enough time searching and you will find [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io).
